# **Summary / Cheat Sheet.**

* Users & accounts all managed in AWS.
* We can centrally manage those using AWS Organisations.
* AWS Control Tower is used to automate the setup & compliance of multi-account AWS environments adhering to industry best practices.
* We can do federation in many ways:
    * SAML 2.0.
    * SAML with a custom identity broker using the (GetFederationToken STS API).
    * AWS IAM Identity Center (Single Sign On) to connect to multiple AWS accounts within an organisation & 3rd party SAML 2.0-compatible apps.
    * Web identity federation without Cognito (not recommended).
    * Web identity federation with Cognito.
* AWS Directory Services offers AWS managed Active Directory services:
    * Managed Microsoft AD - can be used as a standalone or can setup a one or two way trust with on-premise Microsoft AD's.
        * Supports MFA.
        * Supports seamless joins.
        * Has RDS integration.
    * AD Connector - proxy requests to on-premise Microsoft AD's.
    * Simple AD - standalone & cheap AD-compatible with no MFA or advanced capabilities.
* AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share resources across accounts & organisations.
* The exam tends (is not guaranteed) to lean you towards using more modern services such as IAM Identity Center & Web Identity with Cognito, but you must know all of the services.
