# **Instantiating Applications.**

We haven't really spoken about how to instantiate our applications onto our proposed architecture.

When launching a full stack (EC2, RDS etc.) it can take time to:

* Install applications.
* Insert initial (or recovery) data.
* Configure everything to our needs.
* Launch an application.

How can we speed that up?

## **Increasing instantiating speed.**

* EC2 Instances:
    * **Use a Golden AMI** - we can install our applications, OS dependencies etc. beforehand and launch our EC2 instance(s) from our Golden AMI.
    * We can launch future instances using this Golden AMI (via an auto-scaling group).
    * Configurations & dependencies already installed on future instances - saving lots of time.
    * **Bootstrapping using User Data** - we have already seen / used bootstrap scripts that will install dependencies and configure our instances on start-up this may save some time, but is no-where near as efficient as a Golden AMI.
    * **Hybrid** - we can use a Golden AMI and User Data (Elastic Beanstalk).
* RDS Databases:
    * **Restore from a snapshot** - the database will have schemas and data ready.
* EBS Volumes:
    * **Restore from a snapshot** - the disk will already be formatted and have data.
