# **S3 Object Lambda.**

## **S3 Access Points.**

* Create access points for specific S3 partitions that specific user groups can access.
* For example, create an access point for the "/finance/..." partition for the "finance" user group / IAM role.
* A policy needs to be added to the specific user group / IAM role as well as the access point itself to allow read/write permissions to the access point.
* Each access point has it's own DNS & it's own policy.

## **S3 Object Lambda.**

* Use Lambda Functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the application calling it.
* Only one S3 bucket is needed, on top of which we create S3 Access Points & S3 Object Lambda Access Points.
* Use cases:
    * Redact PII for analytics or non-productive environments.
    * Converting across data formats such as converting XML to JSON.
    * Resizing watermarking images.
