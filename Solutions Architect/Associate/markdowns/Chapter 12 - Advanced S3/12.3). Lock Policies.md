# **Lock Policies.**

## **Glacier Vault Lock.**

* Adopts a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model.
* You can lock the policy for future edits (and can thus no longer be changed).
* Helpful for compliance data retention.

## **S3 Object Lock.**

* Versioning must be enabled.
* Also adopts a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model.
* Block an object version deletion for a specific amount of time.
* Object Retention (available options):
    * Retention period - specifies a fixed period.
    * Legal Hold - same protection but no expiry date.
* Modes (available options):
    * Governance Mode - users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.
    * Compliance Mode - a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. When an object is locked in compliance mode, its retention cannot be changed & its retention period cannot be shortened.
