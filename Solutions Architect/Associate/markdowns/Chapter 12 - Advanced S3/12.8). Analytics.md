#Â **S3 Analytics - Storage Class Analysis.**

* You can set up S3 Analytics to help determine when to transition objects from "Standard" to "Standard-IA".
* This does not work for "OneZone-IA" or "Glacier".
* The report is updated daily.
* It takes around 24 - 48 hours to generate the report.
* Used as a good first-step to producing life-cycle rules (or improving them).
