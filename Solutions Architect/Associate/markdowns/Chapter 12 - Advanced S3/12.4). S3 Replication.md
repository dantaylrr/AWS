# **S3 Replication.**

We can replicate the contents of an S3 bucket either "Cross-Region" or "Same-Region".

* **You must enable versioning** in both the source & destination buckets.
* Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is when you want to replicate the contents of an S3 bucket into another AWS region.
* Same-Region Replication (SRR) is when you want to replicate the contents of an S3 bucket into the same region as the source bucket.
* Buckets can be in different AWS accounts.
* Copying of content is asynchronous.
* Must give the appropriate IAM permissions to S3.

Use cases:
* CRR - compliance, low-latency access, replication across accounts.
* SRR - log aggregation, live replications between production & test accounts, disaster recovery.

## **Important Notes.**

* After activating, only new objects are replicated.
* Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using **S3 Batch Replication.**
    * This replicates existing objects & objects that failed replication.
* For DELETE operations:
    * Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional).
    * Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes).
* There is no chaining of replication.
    * If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, source (bucket 1) cannot be replicated into bucket 3.
