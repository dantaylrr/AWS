# **MFA Delete.**

* MFA (multi factor authentication) forces the user to generate a code on a device (such as a smartphone) before doing important operations on S3.
* To use MFA-Delete, we first need to enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
* We need MFA Delete to:
    * Permanently delete an object version.
    * Suspend versioning on the bucket.
* You won't need MFA Delete for:
    * Enable versioning.
    * Listing deleted versions.
* **Only the bucket owner (root account owner) can enable/disable MFA-Delete.**
* MFA-Delete can only be enabled using the CLI currently.
