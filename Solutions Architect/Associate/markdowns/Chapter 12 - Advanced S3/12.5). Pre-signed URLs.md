# **Pre-Signed URLs.**

* You can generate pre-signed URLs using the AWS SDK or the CLI.
    * For downloads (CLI).
    * For uploads (harder, must use the SDK).
* Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change the timeout "--expires-in [TIME_BY_SECONDS]" argument.
* Users are given a pre-signed URL in which they will inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for GET/PUT requests.

Here are some examples of why you would want to do this:
* Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video in your S3 bucket.
* Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically.
* Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in your bucket.
