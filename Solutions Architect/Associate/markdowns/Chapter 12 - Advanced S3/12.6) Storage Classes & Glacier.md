# **Storage Classes.**

There are many different storage classes in S3, here are some examples:

* Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose.
* Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA).
* Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access.
* Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
* Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
* Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Dive.
* Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering.

You can move between storage classes or by using S3 Lifecycle configurations.

## **Durability & Availability.**

Durability:
* Represents how often an object can be "lost" by Amazon S3.
    * S3 has extremely high durability - 99.999999999% of objects across multiple availability zones.
    * If you store 10,000,000 objects with S3 then you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years.
    * Same for all storage classes.

Availability:
* Represents how readily available a service is.
    * Varies depending on the storage class.
    * S3 Standard has 99.99% availability, so would not be available for 53 minutes across a year.

## **S3 Standard - General Purpose.**

* Has 99.99% availability.
* Used for frequently accessed data.
* Low latency & high throughput.
* Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures/
* Use Cases:
    * Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution...

## **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA).**

* For data that is less frequently access, but requires rapid access when needed.
* Lower cost than S3 standard.
* **Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)**:
    * 99.99% availability.
    * Use cases:
        * Disaster Recovery, Backups...
* **Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)**:
    * High durability (99.999999999%) in a single AZ - data is lost when the AZ is destroyed.
    * 99.5% availability.
    * Use Cases:
        * Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate.

## **Glacier Storage Classes.**

* Low-cost object storage meant for archiving/backups.
* You pay for the storage + the object retrieval cost.
* **Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**:
    * Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter.
    * Minimum storage duration of 90 days.
* **Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**:
    * There are 3 different types of flexibility (when we recieve our data) - Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) - all free.
    * Minimum storage duration of 90 days.
* **Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive**:
    * For long-term storage.
    * 2 types of flexibility - Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours).
    * Minimum storage duration of 180 days.

## **S3 Intelligent Tiering.**

* Small monthly monitoring & auto-tiering for free.
* Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage.
* There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

There are 3 different types of tier available:
* Frequent Access tier (automatic) - default tier.
* Infrequent Access tier (automatic) - objects not accessed for 30 days.
* Archive Instant Access tier (automatic) - objects not accessed for 90 days.
* Archive Access tier (optional) - configurable from 90 days to 700+ days.
* Deep Archive Access tier (optional) - configurable from 180 days to 700+ days.
