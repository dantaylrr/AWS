# **SQS vs SNS vs Kinesis.**

* SQS:
    * Consumers "pull data" or "poll" for data.
    * Data is deleted after being consumed.
    * Can have as many consumers as you want.
    * No need to provision throughput.
    * Ordering is only guarenteed with FIFO queues.
    * Individual message delay capability.
* SNS:
    * Pub / Sub model.
    * Push data to many subscribers.
    * Up to 12,500,000 subscribers.
    * Data is not persisted (lost if not delivered).
    * Up to 100,000 topics.
    * No need to provision throughput.
    * Integrates with SQS for fan-out architecture.
    * FIFO capability for SQS FIFO.
* Kinesis:
    * 2 modes of consumption:
        * Standard mode to pull data from Kinesis.
            * 2 MB per shard.
        * Enhanced fan-out to push data from Kinesis to consumers.
            * 2 MB per shard per consumer.
    * Data is persisted so can be replayed.
    * Meant for real-time big data, analytics & ETL.
    * Ordering is preserved at the shard level.
    * Data expires after 1-365 days.
    * There are two types of capacity:
        * Provisioned mode - used if we know how many shards we'll need in advance.
        * On-demand mode - used if we want our shards to scale to demand.
