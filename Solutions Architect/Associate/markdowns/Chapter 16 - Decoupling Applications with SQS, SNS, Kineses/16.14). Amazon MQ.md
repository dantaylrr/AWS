# **Overview.**

* SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services, they're using propriety protocols from AWS.
* Traditional applications running from on-premise may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS etc.
* **When migrating to the cloud**, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS & SNS, we can use Amazon MQ.
* Amazon MQ = Managed service of Apache ActiveMQ.
* Amazon MQ doesn't scale as much as SQS / SNS.
* Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine, which can run in high-availability with failover.
* Amazon MQ has both queue features (SQS) & topic features (SNS).

## **High Availability.**

* For failover, we use Amazon EFS mounted across EC2 instances in different AZ's.
* Thus giving us an "active" instance & a "standby" instance - both sharing the same file system / storage.
