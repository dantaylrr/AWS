# **SQS Long Polling.**

* When a consumer requests messages from the queue, it can optionally "wait" for messages to arrive if there are none in the queue.
* This is called "Long Polling".
    * This can be used to reduce latency.
    * Can also be used to reduce SQS API calls.
* This might increase the efficiency of your application.
* The wait time can be between 1 second to 20 second.
* Long Polling is preferable to Short Polling.
* Long Polling can be enabled at the queue level or at the API level using the "WaitTimeSeconds" parameter.
