# **SQS Dead Letter Queues.**

* If a consumer fails to process a message within the Visibility Timeout, the message will go back into the queue.
* We can set a threshold of how many times a message can go back into the queue.
* We can set a "MaximumReceives" threshold.
* Once the Maximum Received threshold is exceeded, the message goes into a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
* Useful for debugging.
* Make sure to processes in the DLQ before thet expire.
    * Good to set the retention period to 14 days for these messages.

## **Redrive to Source.**

* Feature to help consume messages in the DLQ to understand what is wrong with them.
* We can do a manual inspection & debug on the messages in the DLQ.
* Once the issue is identified & consumer code is refactored, we can redrive the messages from the DLQ back into the source queue in batches without writing custom code.
