# **Integration & Messaging.**

* When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another.
* There are two patterns of application communication.
* Synchronous communication:
    * Application to application.
    * Envision a buying application communicating directly with a shipping application...
* Asynchronous / Event based communication:
    * Application to queue to application.
    * Envision a buying application communicating with a queue service, each order gets put into a queue where the shipping application consumes each order from the queue...
* Synchronous applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes in traffic.
* What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually it's only 10?
* In this case, **it's beneficial to decouple your applications.**
    * We could use SQS for a queue model.
    * We could use SNS for a publisher/subscriber model.
    * We could use Kinesis for a real-time streaming model.
* **These services can scale independently from our application.**
