# **Versioning.**

* You can version your files in Amazon S3.
* It is enabled at the bucket version.
* If you upload a file with the same key then the new file will not override the old file, instead the file will become "versioned" (1, 2, 3...).
* It is best practice to version your buckets.
    * This protects against unintended deletes of files.
    * Gives us the ability to restore or roll back to a previous version of a file.
* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have the version "null".
* Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions.
