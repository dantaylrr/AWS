# **CORS.**

* An **origin** is a scheme (protocol), host(domain) and a port.
    * e.g. https://www.example.com
    * Here, our scheme is HTTPS, the host is www.example.com & the port is 443.
* CORS means Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* Web Browser based mechanisms allow requests to other origins whilst visiting the same origin.
* Examples of same origins - https://www.example.com/app1 & https://www.example.com/app2
* Examples of different origins - https://www.example.com & https://other.example.com
* The requests won't be fulfilled unless the other origin allows for the requests, this is done using **CORS Headers** (Access-Control-Allow-Origin).

## **S3 CORS.**

* If a client does a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers.
* **This is a popular exam question.**
* You can allow for a specfic origin or for all origins (*).

The theory suggests that you set up two buckets, both enabled as a website but one is also enabled as a "Cross Origin" bucket.

We will GET index.html from the "standard" bucket, this file will tell us to perform a GET/PUT/DELETE request to the Cross Origin bucket.
