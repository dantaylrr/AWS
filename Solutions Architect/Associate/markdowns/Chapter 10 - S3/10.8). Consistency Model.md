# **S3 Consistency Model.**

S3 has a strong consistency model as of December 2020.

What does this mean?

* After a:
    * Successful write of any new objects (new PUT request).
    * An overwrite or delete of an existing object (overwrite PUT or DELETE request).
* ...any:
    * Subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object - this is called "read after write consistency".
    * Subsequent list requests immediately reflect the changes made - this is called "list consistency".

These features are available at no additional cost & without any performance impact.
