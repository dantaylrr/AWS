# **Athena Overview.**

**Athena is a serverless query service that can be used to perform analytics on the content of S3 objects.**

Some important notes about Athena:

* It uses standard SQL language to query objects / files.
* Supports CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet... etc.
* Athena is built on Presto.
* **Pricing:**
    * $5 per TB of data scanned.
    * This is why using compressed or columnar datasets such as Parquet or Avro is preferred as it saves costs (doing less scanning, storing less bytes).
* **Use Cases:**
    * Business Intelligence.
    * Analytics.
    * Reporting.
    * Querying logs.
    * Querying CloudTrail.
* You have to set up a query result location before you can start querying data.

## **Performance Improvement.**

* Use columnar data for cost saving (less scanning).
    * Parquet or ORC is recommended.
    * Huge performance improvement.
    * Use Glue to convert data into parquet or ORC.
* Compress data into smaller intervals (bzip2, gzip, lz4, snappy, ...).
* Partition datasets in S3 for easy querying on virtual columns.
* Use larger files (> 128 MB) to minimize overhead.
