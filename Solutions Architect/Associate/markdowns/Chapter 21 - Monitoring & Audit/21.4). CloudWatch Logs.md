# **CloudWatch Logs.**

* Logs are categorised into **log groups**, this is an arbitrary name that usually represents an application.
* These are further broken down into **log streams**, these are instances with the application / log files / application (usually broken down into time intervals).
* Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 30 days etc.).
* CloudWatch logs can be exported to:
    * S3.

## **Metric Filter & Insights.**
