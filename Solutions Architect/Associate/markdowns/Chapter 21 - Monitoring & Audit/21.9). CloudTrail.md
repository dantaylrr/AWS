# **CloudTrail.**

* Provides governance, compliance & audit for your AWS account.
* CloudTrail is enabled by default.
* Get a history of events / API calls made within your AWS account by:
    * Console.
    * SDK.
    * CLI.
    * AWS Services.
* Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch logs or S3.
* A trail can be applied to All Regions (by default) or a single region.
* If a resource is deleted in AWS - inestigate CloudTrail first!

## **CloudTrail Events.**

* Management events:
    * Operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account.
    * e.g. configuring security (IAM ```AttachRolePolicy```), configuring rules for reouting data (EC2 ```CreateSubnet```), setting up logging (CloudTrail ```CreateTrail```).
    * By default, trails are configured to log management events.
    * Can separate **Read events** (that don't modify resources) from **Write events** (that do modify resources).
* Data Events:
    * By default, data events are not logged (due to high volumes).
    * S3 object-level activity (e.g. ```GetObject```, ```DeleteObject```, etc...).
    * Can separate Read & Write events.
    * AWS Lambda function execution activity (```Invoke```).

## **CloudTrail Insights.**

* Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity in your account:
    * Inaccurate resource provisioning.
    * Hitting service limits.
    * Bursts of IAM actions.
    * Gaps in periodic maintenance activity.
* CloudTrail Insights analyses normal management events to create a baseline.
* It then continuously analyses write events to detect unusual patterns.
* Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console.
* Event is sent to S3.
* An EventBridge event is generated.

## **CloudTrail Events Retention.**

* Events by default are stored for 90 days before being deleted.
* To keep events beyond this period, log them to S3 & use Athena to analyse them.
