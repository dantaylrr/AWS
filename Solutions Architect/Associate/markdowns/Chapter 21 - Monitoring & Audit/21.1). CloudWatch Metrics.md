# **CloudWatch.**

* CloudWatch provides metrics for every AWS service.
* Metrics are variables of your application that are being monitored (CPU Utilisation, NetworkIn, etc...).
* Metrics belong to namespaces.
* A dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment etc...).
* You can set up to 10 dimensions per metric.
* Metrics have timestamps.

## **EC2 Detailed Monitoring.**

* EC2 instance metrics are collected every 5 minutes.
* With detailed monitoring (at a cost), you get data every 1 minute.
* Use detailed monitoring if you want to scale an ASG faster.
* The AWS free tier allows us to have 10 detailed monitoring metrics.
* Note - EC2 Memory Usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed from inside the EC2 instance as a custom metric).
