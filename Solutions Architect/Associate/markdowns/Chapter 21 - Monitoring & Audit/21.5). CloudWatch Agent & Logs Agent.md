# **CloudWatch Agent & Logs Agent.**

* We can use the CloudWatch Agent to send logs from our EC2 instances into CloudWatch.
* By default, EC2 doesn't collect any logs.
* The CloudWatch agent works by pushing specified log files into CloudWatch.
* Your EC2 instance must have the correct / appropriate IAM role to do so.
* The CloudWatch Agent can also be setup on-premise.

## **Log Agent & Unified Agent.**

* For virtual servers (EC2 instances, on-premise servers...)
* Log Agent:
    * Older version of the agent.
    * Can only send to CloudWatch Logs.
* Unified Agent:
    * Collects additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes etc...
    * Collect logs to send to CloudWatch logs.
    * Centralised configuration using SSM Parameter Store.

## **Unified Agent - Metrics.**

* Collected directly on your linus server / EC2 instance.
* These metrics include:
    * CPU (active, guest, idle, system, user, steal).
    * Disk metrics (free, used, total).
    * Disk IO (write, reads, bytes, iops).
    * RAM (free, inactive, used, total, cached).
    * Netstat (number of TCP & UDP connections, net packets, bytes).
    * Processes (total, dead, bloqued, idle, running, sleep).
    * Swap Space (free, used, used %).
