# **Cloudwatch Custom Metrics.**

* Gives the ability to define & send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch.
* e.g. RAM usage, disk space, number of logged users etc...
* Can use the API call PutMetricData.
* Ability to use dimensions (attributes) to segment metrics by:
    * Instance ID.
    * Environment name (dev, prod...).
* Metric resolution (StorageResolution API parameter) - two possible values:
    * Standard (every minute).
    * High Resolution (every 1/5/10/30 seconds) - at a higher cost.
* **Important - you can push historic / future metrics to CloudWatch too, the API accepts metric data points two weeks in the past as well as two hours into the future, just make sure to configure your EC2 instance time correctly.**
