# **CloudWatch Container Insights.**

* Collect, aggregate, summarise metrics & logs from containers.
* Available on containers on:
    * ECS.
    * EKS.
    * Kubernetes platforms on EC2.
    * Fargate.
* In Amazon EKS & Kubernetes, CloudWatch Insights is using a containerised version of the CloudWatch agent to discover containers.

## **CloudWatch Lambda Insights.**

* Monitoring & troubleshooting solution for serverless applications running on AWS Lambda.
* Collects, aggregates & summarises system-level metrics including CPU time, memory disk & network.
* Collects, aggregates & summarises diagnostic information such as cold starts & Lambda worker shutdowns.
* Lambda insights is provided as a Lambda layer.

## **CloudWatch Contributor Insights.**

* Analyse log data & create time-series that display contributor data:
    * See metrics about the top-N contributors.
    * The total number of unique contributors & their usage.
* This helps you find top talkers & understand who or what is impacting system performance.
* Works for any AWS-generated logs (VPC, DNS, etc...).
* For example:
    * We can identify bad hosts.
    * Find URLs that generate the most errors.
* You can build rules from scratch, or you can also use sample rules that AWS has created - leverages CloudWatch logs.

## **Application Insights.**

* Provides automated dashboards that show potential problems with monitored applications, to help isolate on-going issues.
* Your applications run on EC2 instances with select technologies only (Java, .NET, etc...).
* You can use other AWS resources such as EBS, RDS, ELB, ASG, etc...
* Powered by SageMaker.
* Enhanced visibility into your application health to recude the time it will take you to troubleshoot & repair your applications.
* Findings & alerts are sent to Amazon EventBridge & SSM OpsCenter.
