# **CloudWatch Alarms.**

* Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric.
* Various options (sampling, % max, min, etc...).
* Possible alarm states:
    * OK.
    * INSUFFICIENT_DATA.
    * ALARM.
* Period:
    * Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric.
    * High resolution custom metrics - 10 seconds, 30 seconds or multiples of 60 seconds.

## **Alarm Targets.**

* Stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance.
* Trigger an Auto Scaling action.
* Send a notification to SNS.

## **EC2 Instance Recovery.**

* Status checks:
    * Instance status - check the EC2 VM.
    * System status - check the underlying hardware.
* Once an EC2 instance goes into a recovery state or action you get the same private, public, elastic IP's, same metadata & placement group.

## **Good To Knows.**

* Alarms can be based on CloudWatch Logs Metric Filters.
* To test alarms & notifications, set the alarm state to "ALARM" using the CLI.
