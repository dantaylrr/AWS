# **Aurora.**

* Compatible API for PostgreSQL / MySQL.
* Data is held in 6 replicas, across 3 different AZ's.
* Auto healing capabilities.
* Multi-AZ, auto-scaling Read Replicas.
* Read Replicas can be global.
* Aurora can be Global for data recovery or latency purposes.
* Auto scaling of storage from 10GB to 128TB.
* Define EC2 instance types for Aurora instances.
* Same security / monitoring / maintenance features as RDS.
* Aurora Serverless - for unpredictable / intermittent workloads.
* Aurora Multi-Master - for continuous writes failover.
* Use cases:
    * Store relational datasets (RDBMS / OLTP).
    * Perform SQL queries.
    * Transactional inserts / updates / deletes.
    * Less maintenance, more flexibility, better performance.

## **Aurora for Solutions Architects.**

* **Operations** - less operations, auto scaling storage.
* **Security** - AWS is responsible for OS security, we are responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, authorising DB users, using SSL.
* **Reliability** - multi-AZ, highly available, possibly more than RDS, Aurora serverless option, Aurora multi-master option.
* **Performance** - 5x performance (according to AWS) due to architectural optimisations. Up to 15 Read Replicas (only 5 for RDS).
* **Cost** - Pay per hour based on EC2 & storage usage. Possibly lower costs compared to Enterprise grade databases such as Oracle.
