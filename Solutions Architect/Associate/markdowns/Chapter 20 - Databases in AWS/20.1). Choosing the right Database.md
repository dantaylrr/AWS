# **Choosing the right Database in AWS.**

We have a lot of managed databases on AWS to choose from...

Questions to choose the right database based on your architecture...

Is the use case:
* Read heavy, write heavy or a balanced workload.
* What are the throughput needs?
* Will the requirements ever change?
* Does it need to scale?
* How much data is being stored & for how long? Will data grow? What is the average object size?
* How is data accessed?
* Data durability? Does the data need to be an absolute source of truth.
* Latency requirements? Concurrent users?
* What is the data model? How will the data be queried?
* Will there be joins required?
* Is data structured or semi-structured?
* Will it be for reporting purposes? Searching purposes?
* Relational database or NoSQL.
