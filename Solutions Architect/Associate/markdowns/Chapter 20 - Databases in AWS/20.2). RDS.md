# **RDS.**

* Managed PostgreSQL / MySQL / Oracle / SQL Server.
* Must provision an EC2 Instance & EBS Volume type & size.
* Support for Read Replicas & Multi-AZ.
* Security through IAM, Security Groups, KMS, SSL in transit.
* Backups / Snapshots / Point in time restore feature.
* Managed & Scheduled maintenance.
* Monitoring through Cloudwatch.
* Use cases include:
    * Store relational datasets (RDBMS / OLTP).
    * Perform SQL queries.
    * Transactional inserts / updates / deletes.

## **RDS for Solutions Architects.**

* **Operations** - small downtime when failover happens, when maintenance happens, scaling in read replicas / EC2 Instances / restore EBS implies manual intervention, application changes.
* **Security** - AWS is responsible for OS security, we are responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, authorising DB users, using SSL etc.
* **Reliability** - multi-AZ feature, failover in case of failures.
* **Performance** - depends on the EC2 instance type, EBS volume type, ability to add Read Replicas. Storage auto-scaling & manual scaling of instances.
* **Cost** - pay per hour based on provisioned EC2 & EBS.
