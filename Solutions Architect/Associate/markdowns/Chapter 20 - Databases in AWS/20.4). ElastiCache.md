# **ElastiCache.**

* Managed Redis / Memcached (similar offering as RDS but for caches).
* In-memory data store, sub-millisecond latency.
* Must provision an EC2 instance.
* Support for clustering (Redis) & multi-AZ, Read Replicas (sharding in this case).
* Security through IAM, security groups, KMS, Redis Auth.
* Backup / Snapshot / Point in time restore feature.
* Managed & scheduled maintenance.
* Monitoring through CloudWatch.
* Use cases:
    * Key : Value stores.
    * Frequent reads, less writes.
    * Cache results for DB queries.
    * Store session data for websites.
    * Cannot use SQL.

## **ElastiCache for Solutions Architects.**

* **Operations** - small downtime when failover happens, when maintenance happens, scaling in read replicas / EC2 Instances / restore EBS implies manual intervention, application changes.
* **Security** - AWS is responsible for OS security, we are responsible for setting up KMS, security groups, IAM policies, users (Redis Auth), using SSL.
* **Reliability** - clustering, multi-AZ.
* **Performance** - sub-millisecond performance, in-memory, Read Replicas for sharding, very popular cache option.
* **Cost** - pay per hour based on EC2 & storage usage.
