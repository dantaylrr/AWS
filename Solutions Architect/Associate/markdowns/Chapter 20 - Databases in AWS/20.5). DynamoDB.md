# **DynamoDB.**

* AWS proprietary technology, managed NoSQL database.
* Serverless, provisioned capacity, auto scaling, on demand capacity.
* Can replace ElastiCache as a key : value store.
* Highly available, multi-AZ by default, read & writes are decoupled, DAX for read cache
* Reads can be eventually consistent or strongly consistent.
* Security, authentication & authorisation is done through IAM.
* DynamoDB Streams to integrate with AWS Lambda.
* Backup / Restore feature, Global Table feature.
* Monitoring through CloudWatch.
* Can only query on primary key, sort key or indexes.
* Use Cases:
    * Serverless application development (small objects). 
    * Distributed serverless cache. 
    * Doesn't allow for SQL querying.
    * Has transactions capability from Nov 2018.

## **DynamoDB for Solutions Architects.**

* **Operations** - no operations needed, auto scaling capability, serverless.
* **Security** - full security through IAM policies, KMS encryption, SSL in-flight.
* **Reliability** - multi-AZ, backups.
* **Performance** - single digit millisecond performance, DAX for caching reads, performance doesn't degrade if your application scales.
* **Cost** - pay per provisioned capacity & storage usage (no need to guess in advance any capacity - can use auto scaling).
