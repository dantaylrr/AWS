# **OpenSearch.**

* OpenSearch is a successor to ElasticSearch.
* e.g. - In DynamoDB, you can only find by primary key or indexes.
* With OpenSearch, you can search any field, even partial matches.
* It's common to use OpenSearch as a complement to another database.
* OpenSearch also has some usage for Big Data applications.
* You can provision a cluster of instances.
* Built-in integrations with:
    * Kinesis Firehose.
    * IoT.
    * Cloudwatch Logs.
* Security is provided through IAM, KMS, SSL, VPC & Cognito.
* Comes with OpenSearch dashboards.

## **OpenSearch for Solutions Architects.**

* **Operations** - small downtime when failover happens, when maintenance happens, scaling in read replicas / EC2 Instances / restore EBS implies manual intervention, application changes.
* **Security** - Cognito, IAM, VPC, KMS, SSL.
* **Reliability** - multi-AZ & clustering.
* **Performance** - based on the ElasticSearch project (which is open source), can scale to petabytes.
* **Cost** - pay per provisioned node.

**OpenSearch = Searching / Indexing**.
