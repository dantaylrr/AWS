# **EC2 Instance Metadata.**

* AWS EC2 Instance Metadata is an extremely powerful tool but is also one of the least known features to developers.
* It allows AWS EC2 instances to "learn about themselves" **without using an IAM role for that purpose**.
* The URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data (using "curl" from EC2 instance command prompt).
* This is an internal AWS specific URL that allows the EC2 instance to access it's own metadata.
* You can retrieve the IAM role name from the metadata, but you cannot explicitely retrieve the IAM policy.
