# **SDK.**

What if you want to perform actions on AWS directly from your application code (without using the CLI).

You can use the SDK (software development kit).

These official SDK's are available in the following languages:

* Python (boto3)
* Java
* .NET
* Node.js
* PHP
* Go
* Ruby
* C++

We have to use the AWS SDK when we are coding using AWS Services such as DynamoDB, S3 etc.

The AWS CLI uses boto3 (Python).

**Good to know** - if you do not specify or configure a default region, then us-east-1 will be chosen by default.
