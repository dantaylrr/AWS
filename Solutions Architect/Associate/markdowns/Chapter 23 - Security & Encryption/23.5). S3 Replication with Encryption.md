# **S3 Replication Encryption Considerations.**

* Unencrpyted objects & objects that have been encrypted with SSE-S3 are replicated by default.
* Objects encrypted with SSE-C (customer provided key) are never replicated.
* For objects encrypted with SSE-KMS, you need to enable the option.
    * Specify which KMS key to encrypt the objects within the target bucket.
    * Adapt the KMS Key Policy for the target key.
    * An IAM Role with kms:Decrypt for the source KMS key & kms:Encrypt for the target KMS key.
    * You might get KMS throttling errors, in which case you can ask for a Service Quotas increase.
* **You can use multi-region AWS KMS Keys, but they are currently treated as independent keys by Amazon S3 (the object will still be decrypted & then encrypted).**
