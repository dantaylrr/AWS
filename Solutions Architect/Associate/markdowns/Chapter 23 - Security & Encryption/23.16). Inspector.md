# **Inspector.**

* Automated security assessments.
* For EC2 instances:
    * Leverages the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) agent.
    * Analyse against unintended network accessibility.
    * Analyse the running OS against unkniown vulnerabilities.
* For containers push to ECR:
    * Assessment of containers as they are pushed.
* Reporting & integration with AWS Security Hub.
* Send findings to EventBridge.

## **What does Inspector evaluate?**

* Remember - only for EC2 instances & container infrastructure.
* Continuous scanning of infrastructure, only when needed.
* Package vulnerabilities (EC2 & ECR) - database of CVE.
* Network reachability (EC2).
* A risk score is associated with all vulnerabilities for prioritisation.
