# **KMS Key Rotation.**

## **Automatic Key Rotation.**

* For customer-managed CMK (not AWS managed CMK).
* If enabled - automatic key rotation happens every year.
* Previously key is kept active so you can decrypt old data.
* New key has the same CMK ID (only the backing key is changed).

## **Manual Key Rotation.**

* When you want to rotate a key every 90 days, 180 days etc.
* New key has a different CMK ID.
* Keep the previous key active so that you can decrypt old data.
* Better to use alias in this case (to hide the change of key for the application).
* Good solution to rotate CMK that are not eligible for automatic rotation (like an asymmetric CMK).

## **Alias Updating.**

* Better to use aliases in this case (to hide the change of the key for the application).
