# **Encrypted AMI Sharing Process via KMS.**

1). AMI in source account is encrypted with a KMS key from the source account. \
2). Must modify the image attribute to add a **Launch Permission** which corresponds to the specified target account. \
3). Must share the KMS Keys used to encrypt the snapshot the AMI references with the target account / IAM role. \
4). The IAM role/user in the target account must have the permissions to "DescribeKey", "ReEncrypted", "CreateGrant" & "Decrypt". \
5). When launching an EC2 instance from the AMI, optionally the target account can specify a new KMS key in its own account to re-encrypt the volumes.
