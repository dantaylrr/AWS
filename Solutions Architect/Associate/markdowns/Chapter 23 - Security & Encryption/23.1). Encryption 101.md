# **Encryption 101.**

## **Encrpytion in Flight (SSL).**

* Data is encrypted before sending & decrypted after receiving.
* SSL certificates help with encryption (HTTPS).
* Encryption in flight ensures no man in the middle "attack" can happen.

## **Server Side Encryption at Rest.**

* Data is encrypted after being received by the server.
* Data is decrypted before being sent.
* It is stored in an encrypted form thanks to a key.
* The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere & the server must have access to it.

## **Client Side Encryption.**

* Data is encrypted by the client & is never decrypted by the server.
* Data will be decrypted by the receiving client.
* The server should not be able to decrypt the data.
* Could leverage a technique called Envelope Encryption.
