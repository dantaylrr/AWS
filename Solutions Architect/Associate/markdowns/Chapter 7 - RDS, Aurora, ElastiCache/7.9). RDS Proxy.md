# **RDS Proxy.**

* Fully managed database proxy for RDS.
* Allows apps to pool & share the database connections established with the database.
* Connections are established with the proxy instead of the database itself, the proxy allows pooling multiple connections into one to reduce connection workload on the RDS master (reducing stess on CPU / RAM, decreasing likelihood of timeouts).
* Serverless, autoscaling, highly-available (multi-AZ).
* Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up to 66%.
* Supports RDS for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB.
* Supports Aurora for MySQL, PostgreSQL.
* No code changes required for most applications.
* Enforce IAM authentication for DB & securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.
* **RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from the VPC).
