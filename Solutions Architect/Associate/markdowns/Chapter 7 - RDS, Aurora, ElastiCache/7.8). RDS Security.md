**RDS Security.**

* At-rest encryption:
    * Database master & replicas encrypted using KMS - must be defined at launch time.
    * If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted.
    * To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted.
* In-flight encryption:
    * TLS-ready by deafult, use AWS TLS root certificates client-side.
* IAM Authentication:
    * IAM roles to connect to your database (alternative to username/password).
* Security Groups:
    * Control network access to your RDS / Aurora DB.
* No SSH available except for RDS Custom.
* Audit logs can be enabled & sent to CloudWatch logs for longer retention.
