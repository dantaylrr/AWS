# **RDS Custom.**

* Managed Oracle & Microsoft SQL Server databases.
* Gives the user access to the underlying OS & admind access to the database.
* Still get all the benefits provided by RDS service.
* This gives us freedom to:
    * Configure settings.
    * Install patches.
    * Enable native features.
    * Access the underlying hardware (EC2) using SSH or SSH Session Manager.
* De-activate automation mode to perform any customisation, better to take RDS snapshots before you do anything.
* To summarise, RDS vs RDS Custom:
    * RDS - entire DB & the OS is managed by AWS.
    * RDS Custom - full admin access to the underlying OS & database.
