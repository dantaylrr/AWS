# **IPv6 for VPC.**

* IPv4 designed to provide 4.3 billion addresses (which will be exhausted soon).
* IPv6 is the successor of IPv4.
* IPv6 is designed to provide 3.4 x 10^(38) unique IP addresses.
* Every IPv6 address is public & internet-routable (no private range).
* x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x (x is hexadecimal which can range from 0 to ffff).

## **In a VPC.**

* IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC & subnets.
* You can enable IPv6 to operate in dual-stack mode.
* Your EC2 instances will get at least a private internal IPv4 & a public IPv6.
* They can communicate using either IPv4 or IPv6 to the internet through an Internet Gateway.

## **IPv6 Troubleshooting.**

* IPv4 cannot be disabled for your VPC.
* So, if you cannot launch an EC2 instance in your subnet:
    * It's not because it cannot acquire an IPv6.
    * It's because there are no available IPv4 in your subnet.
* **The solution is to create a new IPv4 CIDR in your subnet.**
