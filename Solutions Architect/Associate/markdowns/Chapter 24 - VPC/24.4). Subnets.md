# **Subnets.**

* We can create both a private & public subnet.
* AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet.
* These 5 IP addresses are not available for use & cannot be assigned to an EC2 instance.
* Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are:
    * 10.0.0.0 - network address.
    * 10.0.0.1 - reserved for the VPC router.
    * 10.0.0.2 - reserved for mapping to an Amazon provided DNS.
    * 10.0.0.3 - reserved for future use.
    * 10.0.0.255 - network broadcast address. AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore this address is reserved.

**Exam Tip:**

* If you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
    * You can't choose a subnet of size /27 as even though this gives you 32 IP's to choose from, 5 of those are automatically reserved, thus leaving you with only 27 IP's.
