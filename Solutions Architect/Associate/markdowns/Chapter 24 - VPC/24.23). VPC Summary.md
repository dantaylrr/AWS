# **VPC Summary.**

* CIDR - IP range.
* VPC - Virtual Private Cloud.
* Subnets - tied to an AZ, we define the CIDR we want to use.
* Internet Gateway - at the VPC level, provides IPv4 & IPv6 internet access.
* Must be edited to add routes from subnets to the IGW, VPC Peering connections, VPC Endpoints, etc...
* Bastion Host - public EC2 instance that can be SSH'd into, this host provides SSH connectivity into an EC2 instance in a private subnet.
* NAT Instances - gives internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets. Old, mst be setup in a public subnet, disable Source / Destination check.
* NAT Gateway - managed by AWS, provides scalable internet access to private EC2 instances, IPv4 only.
* Private DNS + Route 53 - enable DNS resolution + DNS hostnames.
* NACL - stateless, subnet rules for inbound & outbound, don't forget Ephemeral Ports.
* Security Groups - stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level.
* Reachability Analyser - perform network connectivity testing between AWS resources.
* VPC Peering - connect two VPC's with non-overlapping CIDR's, non-transitive.
* VPC Endpoints - provide private access to AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, SSM) within a VPC.
* VPC Flow Logs - can be setup at the VPC / Subnet / ENI level, for ACCEPT & REJECT traffic, helps identify attacks, analyse using Athena or CloudWatch Log Insights.
* Site-To-Site VPN - setup a Customer Gateway on DC, a VPGW on VPC & site-to-site VPN's over the public internet.
* VPN CloudHub - hub-and-spoke VPN model to connect to sites.
* Direct Connect - setup a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, establish a direct private connection to an AWS Direct Connect Location.
* Direct Connect Gateway - setup a Direct Connect to many VPCs in different AWS regions.
* AWS PrivateLink / VPC Endpoint Services - connect to services privately from your service VPC to a customers' VPC. Doesn't require VPC Peering, the public internet, NAT Gateways or Routing Tables. **Must be used with a Network Load Balancer & ENI.**
* ClassicLink - connect EC2-Classic EC2 instances privately to your VPC.
* Traffic Mirroring - copy network traffic from ENI's for further analysis.
* Egress-only Internet Gateway - like a NAT Gateway, but for IPv6.
