# **Bastion Hosts.**

* Giving EC2 instances inside the private subnet access to the internet will defeat the point & make them public.
* To get around this, we can use Bastion Hosts.
* We can use a Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances.
* The bastion is in the public subnet which is connected to all other private subnets.
* Bastion Host security group must be tightened.
* **Exam Tip** - Make sure the bastion host only has port 22 traffic from the IP address you need, not from the security groups of your other EC2 instances.
