# **Networking Costs.**

* Use private IP instead of public IP for good savings & better network performance.
* Use same AZ for maximum savings (at the cost of high availability).

## **Minimizing Egress Traffic Networking Cost.**

* Egress traffic - outbound traffic (from AWS to the outside).
* Ingress traffic - inbound traffic (from outside to AWS).
* Try to keep as much traffic within AWS to fully minimise any costs.
* Direct Connect locations that are co-located in the same AWS region result in lower costs for egress networking.

## **S3 Data Transfer Pricing.**

* S3 ingress - free.
* S3 to the internet - egress traffic cost incurred.
* S3 transfer acceleration - faster tranfer times, incurs an additional cost.
* S3 to CloudFront - free.
* CloudFront to the internet - incurs a cost but is slightly cheaper than S3.
* S3 cross-region replication - also incurs a cost.
