# **Non-Default VPCs.**

## **IPv4.**

* You can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max 5 per region - soft limit, can be increased).
* Max CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR:
    * Min size is /28 (16 IP addresses).
    * Max size is /16 (65,536 IP addresses).
* Because a VPC is private, only the private IPv4 ranges are allowed (reminder, these are):
    * 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) - big networks.
    * 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) - AWS default VPC in that range.
    * 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) - home networks.
* **Your VPC CIDR should not overlap with your other networks (e.g. corporate networks).**
