# **VPC Reachability Analyser.**

* A network diagnostics tool that troubleshoots network connectivity between two enpoints in your VPCs.
* It builds a model of the network configuration, then checks the reachability based on these configurations (doesn't send packets).
* When the destination is:
    * Reachable - it produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path.
    * Not reachable - it identifies the blocking components (e.g. security group configurations, NACLs, route tables, etc...).
* Use cases:
    * Troubleshoot connectivity issues.
    * Ensure network configuration is as intended.
