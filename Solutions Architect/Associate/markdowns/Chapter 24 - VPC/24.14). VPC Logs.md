# **VPC Logs.**

* Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
    * VPC flow logs.
    * Subnet flow logs.
    * ENI flow logs.
* Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues.
* Flow logs data can go into S3 / CloudWatch.
* Capture network information from AWS managed interfaces too:
    * ELB.
    * RDS.
    * ElastiCache.
    * Redshift.
    * NATGW.

## **Flow Log Metadata.**

Do not need to remember, but good to know...

* srcaddr & dstaddr - help identify problematic IP's.
* srcport & dstport - help identify problematic ports.
* action - success or failure of the request due to SG / NACL.
* Can all be used for analytics on usage patterns or malicious behaviour.
* Query VPC flow logs using Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights.

## **Troubleshooting SG & NACL Issues.**

* Look at the "action" field.
* Inbound REJECT -> NACL or SG.
* Inbound ACCEPT, Outbound REJECT -> NACL (as SG is stateful).
* Outbound REJECT -> NACL or SG.
* Outbound ACCEPT, Inbound REJECT -> NACL.
