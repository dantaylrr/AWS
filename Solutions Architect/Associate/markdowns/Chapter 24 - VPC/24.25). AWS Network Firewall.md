# **AWS Network Firewall.**

* To protect networks on AWS, so far we've seen:
    * Network Access Control Lists (NACLs).
    * Amazon VPC Security Groups.
    * AWS WAF.
    * AWS Shield & AWS Shield Advanced.
    * AWS Firewall Manager.
* What if we want to protect our entire VPC in a sophisticated way? **We can use AWS Network Firewall**.
* From layer 3 to layer 7 protection:
    * VPC to VPC traffic.
    * Outbound traffic to the internet.
    * Inbound traffic from the internet.
    * To & from Direct Connect & Site-to-Site VPN.
* Internally, AWS Network Firewall uses an AWS Network Load Balancer.
* Rules can be centrally managed cross-account using AWS Firewall Manager to extrapolate rules to multiple VPC's.

## **Fine Grained Controls.**

* Supports thousands of rules:
    * IP & Port.
    * Protocol type.
    * Stateful domain list rule groups - only allow outbound traffic to *.mycorp.com (as an example).
    * General pattern matching using regex.
* Traffic filtering - allow, drop or alert for traffic that matches the rules.
* Active flow inspection to protect against network threats with intrusion-prevention capabilities (like Gateway Load Balancer, but all managed by AWS).
* Send logs of rule matches to S3, CloudWatch logs & Kinesis Data Firehose.
