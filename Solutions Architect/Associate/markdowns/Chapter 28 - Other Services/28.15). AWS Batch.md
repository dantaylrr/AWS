# **AWS Batch.**

* Fully managed batch processing at any scale.
* Efficiently run 100,000's of computing batch jobs on AWS.
* A batch job is a job with a start & an end.
* Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot instances.
* AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute & memory.
* Batch jobs are defined as Docker images & run on ECS.
* Helpful for cost optimisations & focusing less on infrastructure.

## **Batch vs Lambda.**

* Lambda:
    * Time limit.
    * Limited runtimes.
    * Limited temporary disk space.
    * Serverless.
* Batch:
    * No time limit.
    * Any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker image.
    * Relies on EBS / instance store for disk space.
    * Relies on EC2 & is thus not serverless.
