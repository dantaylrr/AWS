# **EMR.**

* EMR stands for Elastic MapReduce.
* EMR helps build Hadoop clusters (big data) to analyse & process vast amounts of data.
* The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances.
* Also supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink, etc...
* EMR takes care of all the provisioning & configuration.
* Auto-scaling & integrated with spot instances.
* Use cases:
    * Data processing.
    * Machine Learning.
    * Web Indexing.
    * Big Data.

## **Node types & purchasing.**

* Master Node - manages the cluster, coordinates, manages health - long running.
* Core Node - run tasks & store data - long running.
* Task Node - just to run tasks - usually spot.
* Purchasing options:
    * On-demand - reliable, predictable, won't be terminated.
    * Reserved (minimum 1 year) - cost savings (EMR will automatically use if available).
    * Spot instances - cheaper, can be terminated, less reliable.
* Can have a long-running cluster or a temporary (transient) cluster.
