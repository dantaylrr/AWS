# **Systems Manager - SSM Session Manager.**

* Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 & on-premise servers.
* No SSH access, bastion hosts or SSH keys.
* No port 22 required (for better security).
* Supports linux, macOS & windows.
* Send session log data to S3 or CloudWatch logs.
* The user accesses the EC2 instance through Session Manager - hence no direct connectivity with the EC2 instance.
