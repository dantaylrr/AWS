# **Introduction to CI/CD.**

## **Continuous Integration.**

* Developers push the code to a code repository (often Github / CodeCommit / BitBucket / etc...).
* A testing / build server checks the code as soon as it is pushed (CodeBuild / Jenkins / etc...).
* Find bugs early, fix bugs.
* Deliver faster as the code is tested.
* Deploy often.
* Unblocked developers.

## **Continuous Delivery.**

* Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed.
* Ensures deployments happen quickly.
* Shifts away from "release every 3 months" to "5 releases every day".
* That usually means automated deployment:
    * CodeDeploy.
    * Jenkins CD.

## **AWS Tech Stack for CI/CD.**

* CodeCommit as a code store.
* CodeBuild for build & test.
* Elastic Beanstalk / CodeDeploy / CloudFormation for deployment & provisioning.
* CodePipeline for pipeline orchestration.
