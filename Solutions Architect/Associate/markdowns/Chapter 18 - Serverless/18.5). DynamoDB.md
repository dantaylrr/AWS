# **Overview.**

DynamoDB is:

* A fully managed, highly available database with replication across multiple AZ's.
* NoSQL database, so a non-relational database.
    * This makes it bad for operational joins & aggregations.
* Scales to massive workloads, a distributed database.
* Can handle millions of requests per second, trillions or rows & 100s Tbs of storage.
* Fast & consistent performance (low latency on retrieval).
* Integrated with IAM for security, authorisation & admin purposes.
* Enables event-driven programming with DynamoDB streams.
* Low cost & auto-scaling capabilities.
* Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) table classes.

## **The Basics.**

* DynamodDB is made of **Tables**.
* There are no visible databases.
* Each table has a **primary Key** (must be decided at creation time).
* Each table can have asn infinite number of items or rows.
* Each item has **attributes** (can be added over time & can be null).
* Maximum size of an item is 400KB.
* Data types that are supported are:
    * Scalar Types - String, Number, Binary, Boolean, Null.
    * Document Types - List, Map.
    * Set Types - String Set, Number Set, Binary Set.

## **Read/Write Capacity Modes.**

* Control how you manage your table's capacity (read / write throughput).
* Provisioned Mode (Default).
    * You specify the number of read / writes per second.
    * You need to plan capacity beforehand.
    * Pay for provisioned Read Capacity Units (RCU) & Write Capacity Units (WCU).
    * Possiblity to add Auto-Scaling mode for RCU & WCU.
* On-Demand Mode:
    * Read/writes automatically scale up/down with your workloads.
    * No capacity planning needed.
    * Pay for what you use, more expensive.
    * Great for unpredictable workloads.
