# **API Gateway Security Options.**

## **IAM Permissions.**

* Create an IAM policy authorisation & attach to a user / role.
* API Gateway verifies IAM permissions passed by the calling application.
* Good to provide access within your own infrastructure.
* Leverages "Sig v4" capability where IAM credentials are in the headers.

## **Lambda Authoriser.**

* Uses Lambda to validate the token in the header being passed.
* Option to cache result of authentication.
* Helps to use OAuth / SAML / 3rd party type of authentication.
* Lambda must return an IAM policy for the user.

## **Cognito User Pools.**

* Cognito fully manages the user lifecycle.
* API Gateway verifies identity automatically from Cognito.
* No custom implementation required.
* **Cognito only helps with authentication, not authorisation**.

## **Summary.**

* IAM:
    * Great for users / roles already within your AWS account.
    * Handle authentication + authorisation.
    * Leverages Sig v4.
* Lambda Authoriser:
    * Great for 3rd party tokens.
    * Very flexible in terms of what IAM policy is returned.
    * Handles authentication + authorisation.
    * Pay per Lambda invocation.
* Cognito User Pool:
    * You manage your own user pool.
    * No need to write any custom code.
    * Must implement authorisation in the backend.
