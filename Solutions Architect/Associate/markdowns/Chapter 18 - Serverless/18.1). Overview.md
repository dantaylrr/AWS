# **What is Serverless.**

* Serverless is a new paradigm in which developers don't have to manage servers anymore.
* It's as simple as deploying code.
* Initially, serverless was perceived as FaaS (Function as a Service).
* Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed such as databases, messaging, storage etc.
* Serverless doesn't mean that there aren't any servers, just that we don't see them.
