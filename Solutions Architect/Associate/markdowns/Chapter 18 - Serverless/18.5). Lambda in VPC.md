# **Lambda in VPC.**

## **Lambda by default.**

* By default, your Lambda function is launched outside of your VPC (in an AWS managed VPC).
* Therefore, it cannot access **private** resources inside your VPC (such as RDS, ElastiCache, Internal Load Balancers etc...).
* It can still access resources available over the public internet.

## **Lambda in VPC.**

* You must define the VPC ID, Subnets & the Security Groups for the Lambda.
* Lambda will create an ENI in your subnets that can be used to interact with private resources.

## **Lambda with RDS Proxy.**

* We have RDS database in a private subnet.
* If Lambda functions (deployed in a VPC) directly access your database & interact with it, they may open up too many connections & overload the database.
* RDS Proxy can solve this by pooling the Lambda connections:
    * Improves scalability.
    * Improve availability by reducing the failover time by 66% & preserving connections.
    * Improve security by enforcing IAM authentication & storing credentials in Secrets Manager.
* **Your Lambda function must be deployed inside your VPC as RDS Proxy is never publicly available.**
