# **Lambda Limits.**

You need to know a few Lambda limits before going into the exam:

**Per region**:

* Execution:
    * Memory allocation is between 128MB - 10GB (in 1MB increments).
    * Maximum execution time is 900 seconds (or 15 minutes).
    * Max size of environment variables is 4KB.
    * Disk capacity in the "function container" (in /tmp) of 512MB.
    * Can have up to 1000 concurrent Lambda executions.
* Deployment:
    * Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip) is 50MB.
    * Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies) is 250MB.
    * Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup.
    * Max size of environment variables is 4KB.
