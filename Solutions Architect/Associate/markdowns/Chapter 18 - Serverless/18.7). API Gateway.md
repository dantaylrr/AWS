# **Overview.**

* Serverless service/application that is provided by AWS that allows us to create REST API's & endpoints.
* AWS Lambda + API Gateway solution gives us no infrastructure to manage.
* Offers support for WebSocket protocols.
* Handle API versioning (v1, v2,...).
* Handle different environments (dev, prod,...)
* Can handle security in it-self using authentication & authorisation.
* Can create API keys, handle request throttling.
* Swagger / Open API import to quickly define APIs.
* Transform & validate requests & responses.
* Generate SDK & API specifications.
* Cache API responses.

## **Integrations.**

* Lambda function:
    * Can invoke lambda functions.
    * Easiest way to expose REST API backed by Lambda.
* HTTP:
    * Expose HTTP endpoints in the backend.
    * e.g. an internal HTTP API on premise, application load balancers.
    * Why? Add rate limiting, user authentications, API keys etc...
* AWS Services:
    * Expose any AWS API through the API Gateway.
    * e.g. start an AWS Step Function workflow, post a message to SQS.
    * Why? Add authentication, deploy publicly, rate control etc...

## **Endpoint Types.**

* Edge-optimised (default):
    * For global clients.
    * Requests are routed through the CloudFront Edge locations (improves latency).
    * The API Gateway still lives in only one region.
* Regional:
    * For clients within the same region.
    * Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over caching strategies & the distribution).
* Private:
    * Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI).
    * Use a resource policy to define access.
