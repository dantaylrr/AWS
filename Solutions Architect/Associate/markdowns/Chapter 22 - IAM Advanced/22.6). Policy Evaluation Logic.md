# **IAM - Policy Evaluation Logic.**

## **Permission Boundaries.**

* IAM Permission Boundaries are supported for users, groups & roles.
* Advanced feature to use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get.
* IAM Permission Boundaries take precedence over IAM Policies when attached to a user.
* Can be used in combinations of AWS Organisations SCP.
* Use Cases:
    * Delegate responsibilities to non admins within their permission boundaries, for example, to create new IAM users.
    * Allow developers to self-assign policies & manage their own permissions, whilst making sure they can't "escalate" their privileges (i.e. make themselves admin).
    * Useful to restrict one specific user (instread of the entire account using organisations & SCP).
* As soon as there is an explicit deny on IAM policies, it takes precedence.
