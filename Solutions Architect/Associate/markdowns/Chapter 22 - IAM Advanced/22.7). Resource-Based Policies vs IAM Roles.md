# **Resource-Based Policies vs IAM Roles.**

* Cross-account S3 access:
    * Attaching a resource-based policy to a resource (e.g. an S3 bucket policy).
    * Using a role as a proxy.

## **Key Differences.**

* When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions & take the permissions assigned to the role.
* When using a resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up his permissions.
* Example - User in Account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A & dump it in an S3 bucket in Account B.

## **EventBridge - Security.**

* When a rule runs, it needs permissions on the target.
* Targets that support resource-based policies:
    * Lambda.
    * SQS.
    * SNS.
    * CloudWatch logs.
    * API Gateway.
* Targets that support an IAM role:
    * Kinesis streams.
    * Systems manager run command.
    * ECS task.
