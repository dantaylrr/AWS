# **High Availability for a Bastion Host.**

* High AZ options:
    * We can run 2 across 2 different AZ's.
        * Can front them with a Network Load Balancer.
        * Note - has to be a Network Load Balancer with a fixed IP as it is the only Load Balancer that supports SSH traffic (TCP / Layer 4 only).
    * Run 1 across 2 AZ's with an auto-scaling group.
* Routing options:
    * If 2 Bastions Hosts - front both with a Network Load Balancer across both AZs (this also means the Bastion Host can live inside the private subnet if wanted).
    * If 1 Bastion Host - use an elastic IP with EC2 user-data script to access it.
