# **S3 Access Logs.**

* For audit purposes, you may want to log all S3 access requests to your bucket.
* Any request made to S3, from any account, authorised or denied, will be logged into another S3 bucket.
* That data can then be analysed using analysis tools such as Athena.

Some good to knows about S3 access logs:

* Do not set your logging bucket to be the monitored bucket.
* This will create a logging loop and the bucket will grow in size exponentially.
