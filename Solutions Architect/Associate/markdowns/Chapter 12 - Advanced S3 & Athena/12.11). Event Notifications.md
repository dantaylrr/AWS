# **Event Notifications.**

What are events?

* Events are actions performed by the S3 API.
* e.g.
    * S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication... etc.
* We can filter objects such as "*.jpg" for all JPEG files.
* Use Cases:
    * We can set an event notification to trigger a lambda function.
    * Send a message with SNS.
    * Send an object to an SQS queue.
* You can create as many S3 events as desired.
* S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds, however, there are cases where it can take a minute or longer.

## **Eventbridge.**

* All S3 events end up in AWS Eventbridge.
* From eventbridge, we can configure rules that can then send event context to over 18 different AWS services as destinations.
* Eventbridge has advanced filtering options with JSON rules (object metadata, object size, name... etc.).
* You can also send event context to multiple destinations.
* Eventbridge has further capabilities such as; Archive, Replay Events... etc.
