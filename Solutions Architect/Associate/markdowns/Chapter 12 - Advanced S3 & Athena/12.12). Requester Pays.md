# **S3 Requester Pays.**

* In general, bucket owners pay for all AWS S3 storage and data tramsfer costs associated with their bucket.
* With **requester pays** buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket.
* This is particularly helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts.
* The requester must be authenticated in AWS & cannot be anonymous.
