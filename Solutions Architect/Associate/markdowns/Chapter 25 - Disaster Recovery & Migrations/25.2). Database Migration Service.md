# **Database Migration Service (DMS).**

* Quickly & securely migrate databases from on-premise into AWS.
* Is resilient & self-healing.
* The source database remains available during the migration.
* Supports:
    * Homogeneous migrations... e.g. Oracle to Oracle.
    * Heterogeneous migrations... e.g. SQL Server to Aurora.
* Continuous data replication using CDC.
* You must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks.

## **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).**

* Convert your database's schema from one engine to another.
* Example OLTP (SQL Server & Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora.
* Example OLAP (Teradata & Oracle) to Redshift.
* You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine.
