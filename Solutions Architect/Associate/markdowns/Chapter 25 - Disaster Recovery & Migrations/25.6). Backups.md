# **Backups.**

* Fully managed service.
* Centrally manage & automate backups across AWS services.
* No need to create custom scripts & manual processes.
* Lots of supported services.
* Supports cross-region backups.
* Supports cross-account backups.
* Supports point-in-time-recovery for supported services.
* On-demand & scheduled backups.
* Tag-based backup policies.
* You can create backup policies known as Backup Plans:
    * Backups frequency (every 12 hours, daily, weekly, monthly, any CRON expression).
    * Backup window.
    * Transition to cold storage (never, days, weeks, months, years).
    * Retention period (always, days, weeks, months, years).

## **Backup Vault Lock.**

* Enforce a WORM (write once, read many) state for all the backups that you store in your AWS Backup Vault.
* Additional layer of defence to protect your backups against:
    * Inadvertent or malicious delete operations.
    * Updates that shorten or alter retention periods.
* Even the root user cannot delete backups when enabled.
