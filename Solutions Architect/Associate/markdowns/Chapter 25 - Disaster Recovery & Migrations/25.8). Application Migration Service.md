# **Application Migration Service (MGN).**

* Planned migration projects by gathering information about on-premises data centers.
* Server utilisation data & dependency mapping are important for migrations.
* We can use the **AWS Application Discovery Service** to assist us with cloud migrations. There are 2 types of discovery services to choose from:
    * Agentless discovery (AWS Agentless Discovery Connector) - useful for VM inventory, configurations, performance history metrics such as CPU, memory & disk usage.
    * Agent-based discovery (AWS Application Discovery Agent) - useful for system configurations, system performance, running processes & details of network connectivity.
* Resulting data can be viewed within AWS Migration Hub.

Once the above has been done, we can start to think about actually migrating to cloud... here we can use **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**.

* We can "rehost" (sometimes called lift & shift) solutions onto cloud.
* This process converts any physical, virtual & cloud-based servers to run directly on AWS.
* Supports a wide-range of platforms, operating systems & databases.
* Minimal downtime & reduced costs.
