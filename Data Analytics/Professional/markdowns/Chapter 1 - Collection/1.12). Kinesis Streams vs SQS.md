# **Kinesis Streams vs SQS.**

## **Kinesis Data Streams.**

* Data can be consumed many times.
* Data is deleted after the retention period.
* Ordering of records is preserved (at the shard level) - even during replays.
* Build multiple applications reading from the same stream independently (pub/sub model).
* "Streaming MapReduce" capability (Spark, Flink, ...).
* Checkpointing needed to track progress of consumption (e.g. Kinesis Client Library with DynamoDB).
* Provisioned mode or on-demand mode.

## **SQS.**

* A queue.
* Used to decouple applications.
* One application per queue.
* Records are deleted after consumption.
* Messages are processed independently for standard queues.
* Ordering for FIFO queues comes with decreased throughput.
* Capability to delay messages.
* Dynamic scaling of load.

## **Use Cases.**

* SQS:
    * Order processing.
    * Image processing.
    * Auto scaling queues according to messages.
    * Buffer & batch messages for future processing.
    * Request offloading.
* Kinesis Data Streams:
    * Fast log & event data collection & processing.
    * Real time metrics & reports.
    * Mobile capture data.
    * Real time data analytics.
    * Gaming data feeds.
    * Complex stream processing.
    * Data from IoT.
