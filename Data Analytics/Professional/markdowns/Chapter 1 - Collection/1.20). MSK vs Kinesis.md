# **MSK vs Kinesis.**

Kinesis:

* 1MB hard limit on message size.
* Data streams with shards.
* Shard splitting & merging.
* TLS in-flight encryption.
* KMS at-test encryption.
* Security:
    * IAM Policies for AuthN/AuthZ.

MSK:

* 1MB default message size, but can be configured up-to 10MB.
* Kafka topics with partitions.
* Can only add partitions to a topic (cannot remove partitions).
* Optional TLS encryption (can be turned on or off).
* KMS at-test encryption.
* Security:
    * Mutual TLS (AuthN) + Kafka ACLs (AuthZ).
    * SASL/SCRAM (AuthN) + Kafka ACLs (AuthZ).
    * IAM Policies for AuthN/AuthZ.
