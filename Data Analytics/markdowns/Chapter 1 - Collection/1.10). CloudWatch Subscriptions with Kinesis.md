# **CloudWatch Logs Subscriptions with Kinesis.**

* You can stream CloudWatch logs into 3 target consumers:
    * Kinesis Data Streams.
    * Kinesis Data Firehose.
    * AWS Lambda.
* We can achieve this using CloudWatch Logs Subscription filters.
* Can be enabled using the CLI.

## **Use Case - CloudWatch Logs into ElasticSearch.**

* We have a near-real-time requirement to ingest CloudWatch logs in ElasticSearch.
* We can set up a CloudWatch logs subscription filter to Kinesis Firehose with ElasticSearch as a destination.
* We can also do data cleansing/enrichment/transformation with a lambda function working in harmony with the Kinesis Data Firehose.
* If we wanted real-time streaming of CloudWatch logs into ElasticSearch, we can replace Firehose with Lambda directly.
* If we want to do real-time analytics on CloudWatch logs, we can replace the Lambda with Kinesis Streams & run analytics in real-time with Kinesis Data Analytics.
