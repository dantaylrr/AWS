## **Developer Associate**.

***Important note - some of the content for the Developer exam is covered in the solutions architect associate exam that I have already passed. Sections where this is the case, I will provide a link to my solutions architect notes. I will also try to depict this by starring (\*) specific sections.***

I am aiming to become AWS certified as a developer associate. I will be using the following resources:

* **Udemy Courses**  
I will be using the following Udemy Course as material:<br>
https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/ <br>
This will be my main learning resource as it will utilise the AWS Free-Tier for hands-on learning.

* **Percipio**  
Percipio has been provided by my company as an additional resource. Similar to aCloudGuru. I will try to utilise this as much as possible & to fill the gaps if I deem necessary.

## **Additional Info**.

**All headers / questions in each markdown that is STARRED (\*) are identified as a common exam question.**

This course provides some sample code which is referred to during the course. Things like simple Lambda functions, API Gateways, S3 Policies etc. I have omitted these for the time-being but will add if deemed necessary.
